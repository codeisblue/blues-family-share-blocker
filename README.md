## Blue's Family Share Blocker

This is a simple extension to Garry's Mod to help server owner prevent banned users from rejoining by creating new steam accounts and family sharing.
This is likely not perfect so if you have any suggestions feel free to let me know and I will try to my best to add them if I have the time.

*Please note that this only works with ULX currently*

## Features
- Can stop anyone using a family shared account from joining your server.
- Will kick any players who are shared with a banned account.
- Will auto ban the owner of a shared account if that account is banned (in turn banning all other shared accounts linked to the owner)

## Install
- Drag and drop the addon into your addons folder.
- Open up the bfsb_config.lua and configure it to how you like.
- Dont forget to add your Steam API key as its very important or it wont work.
- Have fun.
